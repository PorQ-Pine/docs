Some notes about the demo:
- Rotation doesn't work yet in niri: https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/issues/2741
- The right / left buttons to switch windows are a replacement for gestures, which will be added sooner or later
- Potato quality I know
- There is a cut in the video, the best bugs appear when recording and then can't be replicated ;)
