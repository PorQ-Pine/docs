Some notes about the demo:
- Rotation doesn't work yet in niri: https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/issues/2741
- The right / left buttons to switch windows are a replacement for gestures, which will be added sooner or later
- This is pure HRDL kernel, no optimisations for anything
- Potato quality I know
