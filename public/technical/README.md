[This](./graph.png) shows pretty much how it's done

How to read it:
- 🪶 Means it's written/designed from ground up / modified heavily just for the pinenote. I just wanted to see how much things we create and how much we reuse
- 🦀 Means it's written in rust, I was curious how much is rust (Not like other tools are worse, I it's just my curiosity sir)

Also, the graph makes more sense once you understand the partition table
